\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] Bitte Funktion wie in Angabe nennen (\m{eval_dft_vs_fft})
	\item[3.a,b.] auf der x-Achse sollte k von 0-128 gehen (entsprechend der Beschriftung 'frequency bin') -0,5P
	\item[3.c.] fehlt -3P
	\item[3.d.] Erklärung fehlt -1P
	\item[4.] unklare Erklärung der Abtastfrequenz, Zeitskalierung (vermindern der Sample Rate erhöht nicht die Gesamtdauer des Signals - bei zu niedriger Abtastfrequenz wird das Abtasttheorem verletzt.) -0,5P
